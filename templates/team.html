                                <h5>Welcome to our prototype student project, proudly created by a dedicated team of aspiring software engineers.</h5>
                                <p>Our team consists of Cory Wethington, Alice Allen, Jeremy Hankins, Jonathan Owney, and Madaline Criddle, each contributing unique skills to bring this project to life. As students in software development, we are passionate about learning and creating innovative solutions that solve real-world challenges—even if it's just practice for now.</p>
                                <p>Our goal with this prototype is to demonstrate our capabilities in web development, user experience, and secure data management, while providing a glimpse of what a fully functioning e-commerce platform might look like. This is a User Design Methodology prototype meant to showcase our learning in designing and building user interfaces that are both functional and intuitive. We've come together from different walks of life, each bringing our own flair to make this project a success. We hope you enjoy browsing our demo!</p>

                                <h3>Privacy Policy</h3>
                                <p>We take your privacy seriously. Even though this is a prototype student project, we want to make sure any data you enter is handled securely and with care.</p>
                                <ul>
                                  <li><b>Data Encryption</b>: All passwords and billing information are encrypted. We use industry-standard encryption algorithms to ensure that sensitive information remains private and protected.</li>
                                  <li><b>Limited Use</b>: Your data will only be used within the context of this academic project. We will not share your data with any third parties. This project is purely for educational purposes, and any information provided by users will never be used outside the scope of this demonstration.</li>
                                  <li><b>Temporary Data</b>: Since this is a prototype, the data you provide is not intended to be permanent. It will be used solely to help us understand the interactions within our demo environment, and may be deleted as the project evolves.</li>
                                  <li><b>Security Practices</b>: While we are using secure coding practices for this project, it's important to understand that it is still a prototype. This means that although we are taking steps to protect user information, the platform should not be used for any real transactions or sensitive communications.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>We appreciate your trust and understanding as we continue learning and growing as developers. Please remember, this is a User Design Methodology prototype built by students to demonstrate our learning. Your feedback and participation are an invaluable part of our education, and we are grateful for your support.</p>
